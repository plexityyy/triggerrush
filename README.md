# TriggerRush
A super basic arena FPS. Made in [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/120574415654510/TriggerRush).

## Weaponry
Players spawn with all weapons in-game, including;
- Dagger
- Pistol
- Trench Shotgun
- Sten Gun (semi-auto SMG)
- Revolver (headshots result in critical hits)
- Kaboominator (sticky bomb launcher from TF2 except the bombs explode automatically)
- Doomscreamer (rocket launcher)

## Customisation
Players can choose a colour for their character (can only change Hue for now), as well as give them up to two accessories, a shirt, pants, and gender.

## Licensing
Source code is open under the Apache 2.0 License.

Know that I did not make most assets (I just did UI, programming, and animation work).
